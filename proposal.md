# Battlestar Andromeda Proposal

## What is Battlestar Andromeda (working title)?

As a science and space fan, I thought it would be fun to make a game that
utilizes the user to move a spaceship to avoid being hit by an asteroid. This is
similar to the 1980s game "Asteroids", which I didn't know existed
at the time I thought of the game. Similarly, suprise "aliens" will try to attack
the spaceship, including a DIV "alien", containg a picture of Donald Trump for 
humor purposes that will attack the spaceship. 

#### Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

#### Initial thoughts on game structure

I will make this game similar to the racecar game by allowing the user to move a div
a certain amount of pixels. However, this will have an added step of interactivity by
declaring a winner or loser based on if the spaceship div and the asteroid div ever
are in the same position at the same time. 

#### Phases of Completion

* Find an HD background image of the stars
* Create a DIV for the space ship.
* Create DIV's for Asteroids
* Find a picture to represent the spaceship and asteroid DIV
* Create a Donald Trump "Alien invader" in a DIV
* Place the DIV's on an infinite animation so that they are constantly
a threat of danger
* Create logic for the user to move the spaceshape with the up, down, left and right
arrow keys. Create logic in javascript to move the spaceship a certain amount of pixels
each time the user presses a key via an event listner using Jquery. 
* Create "losing logic", for example, each time an asteroid position interacts
with the spaceship position, then the user has lost the game.
* create a form so the user can enter the name
* Let the user know whether S(he) has won or lost the game.
